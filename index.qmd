Hello! My name is Daniela and I am a [NSF Graduate Research](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/about/about-grfp/) & Chancellor's Fellow at UC Berkeley in both the [de Valpine](https://nature.berkeley.edu/~pdevalpine/#about) and [Boettiger](https://www.carlboettiger.info) labs. I'm really interested in infectious disease modeling and I plan to use this time to develop skills in statistical, computational, and mathematical modeling.

On this site you'll get to know a little bit more [about me](about.qmd), the [research](research.qmd) I've done (and am currently doing), and some of my [community work](community.qmd). Because I am currently learning a lot of material on my own, I also intend to provide some [write-ups](stat-blog.qmd) in case that they are useful to anybody. Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time in the world of [musical theater](music-theater.qmd) and I'm always happy to catch a show with someone new!
