    "text": "Hello! My name is Daniela and I am a NSF Graduate Research & Chancellor’s Fellow at UC Berkeley in both the de Valpine and Boettiger labs. I’m really interested in infectious disease modeling and I plan to use this time to develop skills in statistical, computational, and mathematical modeling.\nOn this site you’ll get to know a little bit more about me, the research I’ve done (and am currently doing), and some of my community work. Because I am currently learning a lot of material on my own, I also intend to provide some write-ups in case that they are useful to anybody. Outside of academia, I enjoy spending my time in the world of musical theater and I’m always happy to catch a show with someone new!"

    "text": "Growing up, I always enjoyed math. It was fun to solve these puzzles and figure out what I can create with a set of given rules. In addition to this passion, I also enjoyed playing the piano, a requirement for many children of immigrant parents. By the time I entered high school, I had decided I was going to major in math and music… with no plan for what I would do after college. However, two crucial things happened my senior year: I took AP Environmental Science and I music directed a show for the first time.\nAfter taking APES, I knew that I had to combine math and environmental science somehow, but I wasn’t sure how. I took on a motto: “help someone or something, somewhere.” This led me on a 4-year journey into carbon cycle dynamics, oceanography, and population dynamics, until I ended up in the world infectious disease modeling. After music directing, I realized that this was how to keep my creative skills alive while being in community with others. I ditched the music major and doubled in mathematics and environmental science.\nGraduate school was not a clear step to me until my third year of college. As a child of Mexican immigrants, I rarely saw myself represented in the mentors and professors I had. Though I am eternally grateful to everyone that helped guide me down this path, I am really passionate about the communities I’m a part of and I hope to be the mentor that my younger self wanted.\nWant to create your own free website? First create a quarto website on RStudio, then create a git repository for your website. You then want to connect the two and make sure you can publish it. Woohoo now you have your own free website!"
